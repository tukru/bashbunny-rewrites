System Override Payload

The System Override payload is designed to extract encrypted system information from the target machine using sophisticated AI algorithms. This payload uses a custom-designed logo to blend in with legitimate processes, evading detection from even the most advanced security systems.
Usage

This payload can be used on Windows and Linux operating systems and can be executed in either HID or Storage attack modes. Once executed, the payload will perform the following actions:

    Clear browser history to remove any trace of the payload's activity.
    Locate the system information file on the target machine.
    Encrypt and exfiltrate the system information file to a remote server.
    Delete the encrypted system information file.
    Download a custom-designed logo to the target machine.
    Add the logo to legitimate processes to further blend in with the system.
